# Bubbleshooter made in Raylib using C++

> I Removed the library files this repo because they clutter the it up. If you're planning to clone this for reasons I don't understand you can download Raylib [here](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib). (just follow the [wiki](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-Windows) or use the [releases tab](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases/))

## Bubbleshooter is a classic singleplayer game to play when there is absolutely nothing else left to do.

### Your Goal:
Pop the colored bubbles by shooting similarly colored bubbles at them. If you get more than **four** bubbles of the same color next to each other, you pop the bubbles! Now just do it until the entire screen is cleared to win!

Score points based on how many bubbles you manage to pop in a row! The more bubbles popped per shot, the more points you get!

### Controls:
Use your mouse, the A and D key or your arrow keys to aim (I haven't implemented any of these yet maybe you use mind control in the final version idk) and press space or enter to shoot your bubble!
